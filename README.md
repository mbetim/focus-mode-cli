<h1 align="center">focus-mode-cli 🎯</h1>

<p align="center">A simple CLI tool to block distractions</p>

## 🤔 Why?

It all started when I found myself losing focus during work hours at different websites that weren't adding value to me.

I knew that I could block these pages with some app, extention or in my router settings. However, as good developer, I've decide to build my own tool for this, and since we can easily access a terminal window at any time, it had to be a CLI.

## ⚙️ Features

- [x] Block websites when a focus session is running
- [x] Add and remove domains to the list of websites that will be blocked during the focus session
- [x] Show information about the current focus session
- [ ] Make it hard to stop a focus session (to prevent "accidents")
- [ ] Block or hide distracting applications

## 🛠️ How to build the project

I'm not planning on publishing this to npm (at least yet) since it's a side project for fun and learning new things. But you can still install it manually

1. Clone the repo to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbetim/focus-mode-cli.git
# or
gh repo clone mbetim/focus-mode-cli
```

2. Install the dependencies (the project is using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

```bash
yarn
# or
yarn install
```

3. Install the CLI globally with npm

```bash
npm i -g
```
